# fundamental datatypes

# int, bool, str, complex

# inmutable means once the object is created its content cannot be changed
a = 10 # variable and object
b = 10 # variable and object
# id gives the object thats stored in memory
print(id(a))
print(id(b))

# HAVING THE SAME VALUE STORED IN THE VARIABLE WE HAVE ONE OBJECT
# IT HAS THE SAME VALUE IN MEMORY, IF THE VALUES ARE DIFFERENT TH OBJECT
# AIMS TO DIFFERENT POINTS SO DEFINETLY

#same object
object1 = 0
object2 = 0

#different object
object3 = 0
object4 = 1

# everything in python is an object
